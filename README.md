# InputHandleExample
An example of assigning a controller to a player and handling it.

This is by no means the best way to do something like this or the most useful. It was written in mind to be understandable and adaptable. Actually, did I even write this? I don't remember this at all. It doesn't look like something I wrote. Where did this come from?
